# Arup Lunchtime Python Programming Course

Welcome to the Arup Lunchtime Python Programming course homepage. This repository contains everything you need for the course. Here you will find session notes, links to external resourse, problem sets and solutions.

You can access enrollments for the course on [moodle](https://moodle.arup.com/course/view.php?id=1633).

## Useful Resources

Most of the material can be found on [Automate the Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/). This is a good place to go if you want to revisit what is taught in each section. The author also provides video tutorial on youtube that follow this course closely.

If you are lost, look at these resources (probably in this order):
1. Our Cheat Sheet (see navbar) 
2. Search [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) (you will come to love this site)
3. Ask your fellow Arup course members on the python Slack Channel. Use the downloaded application on your computer or click [Here](https://arupconsulting.slack.com/messages/C5H4Q9QRJ/)

## What this course covers

This course has been broken up into a series of sessions that introduce the concepts involved in computer programming using the python programming language. Each sesson includes a mini lecture and a problem set. It is intended that you attend a session every week.

The course is intended to be worked through in a group. Please join a group and create a [slack](www.slack.com/auâ€Ž) channel for your group (invite your tutor). Sessions 5, 7 & 8 are dedicated for group projects.

### Course Outline

- Install Python 
- Setup a Interactive Development Environment (IDE)
- The command prompt

Session 1: Basics Part A

- Your first program
- Flow control 
- Loops

Session 2: Basics Part B

- Functions
- Module basics

Session 3: Python Data Types

- Lists and tuples
- Dictionaries

Session 4: Working with Files

- Read, edit and write text and csv files

Session 5: Group Project

- Get started making group project
- No course content
- Class will still run to give you access to tutor for help

Session 6: Good Programming Practices

- Structuring your code
- Software development processes
- Version control and developing in teams

Session 7 & 8: Group Project

- Continue working on your group project
- No course content
- Class will still run to give you access to tutor for help

## What you can expect to gain from this course

Having completed the sessions you should be able to:

- Write simple programs that will enable you to do daily tasks more effectively
- Identify opportunities where programming may offer a better outcome than current practice 
- Understand software development practices and work as a team on problems
- Evaluate the merit of developing applications (complexity, 3rd party alternatives etc.)

## Is this course for you

This course is for everyone! Absolutely no background required. However, think of learning programming as learning a language. It takes time to become fluent and hard work is the only way to get there.

## Getting Started

Before the first session, follow through the setup page (see navbar above) and complete the problems in Session 0. It contains installation instructions, pre-reading and a warm-up problem set. You **MUST** complete this before attending the first session.

## Where to get help

If in doubt, ASK! There is a slack channel that has been created for this course. Post any question you have there and one of the tutor or a fellow student will answer your question.

## Acknowledgements

Large parts of this course were carried over from the previous [course](https://github.com/tomvalorsa/python-course). For this we would like to sincerly thank [Tom Valorsa](https://github.com/tomvalorsa), [Ian Mackenzie](https://github.com/ianmackenzie) and [Tom Clark](https://github.com/tomreeveclark) for their contributions to the problem sets and solutions.

We would also like to thank Kim Sherwin and Selma Parris from the Arup Uni team for their help getting all this sorted. We could not have done it without you.

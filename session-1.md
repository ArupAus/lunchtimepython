# Session 1 Problems

In session 1 we learned:

1. How to import a module
2. Flow control and conditionals
3. How to use loops

Work through the following questions at your own pace. Don't forget to ask questions if you get stuck!

## A little theory

- What is the difference between the equal to operator `==` and the assignment operator `=`?
- What is an infinite loop?
- What is the difference between break and continue?
- Which Python utility can you use to run a loop a certain amount of times?

## Journey to work

How far do you have to travel to get to work? Ask the user how many kms they travel to work, then give them a suggestion based on their repsonse:
- if the user travels greater than 5km to work, print 'You should take the train.'
- if the user travels greater than 2km to work, print 'You should cycle.'
- if the user travels 2km or less to work, print 'Stop being lazy and walk!'

Here are some example inputs and their expected outputs:

|Input|Output|
|-----|------|
|6|'You should take the train.'|
|4|'You should cycle'|
|2|'Stop being lazy and walk!'|

## Sum

Calculate the sum of:

- every number from 1 to 100
- every **odd** number from 1 to 100
- every number from 1 to 100 **divisible by 3**

## FizzBuzz

Iterate over each number from 1 to 100. For each number (n) in the range, do the following:
- if n is divisible by 3, print 'Fizz' to the console
- if n is divisible by 5, print 'Buzz' to the console
- if n is divisible by 3 *and* 5, print 'FizzBuzz' to the console
- if none of the above apply, just print n to the console

## Double char

Ask the user to input a string. Return this string, with every character (char) repeated twice.

e.g. 'python' should become 'ppyytthhoonn'

Teacher's pet edition: Ask the user for an number (n) as well. Repeat each char in the given string n times.

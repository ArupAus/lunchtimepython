# Session 0: Getting Set up (Pre-Work)

This session is intended to be completed before attending the first face-to-face session and covers installing python, setting up an interactive development environment and solving a few simple problems.

Follow this guide to get setup. It is not a difficult process but follow the instructions carefully. This way everyone is configured the same way.

## Step 1: Get set up with Slack

Head on over and install Slack from the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/p/slack/9wzdncrdk3wp), or from [Slack](https://slack.com/get). 

Once Slack is installed, you'll be prompted to answer a few questions:

1. You'll be asked to enter your team's Slack URL. Type `arupconsulting` into the text box and select `Continue`.

2. You'll be asked to enter your Arup email. Type your Arup email into the text box and select `Continue`.

3. You should have received a confirmation email - click the link in the email to continue. You'll need to select the team (Click on the `Arup` team with a picture of Ove Arup). You'll be asked to enter a few details about yourself, and pick a username. Enter in your details and continue on to the next step.

4. On the left you will see a purple navigation pane. Click on `Channels`.

5. Into the search box type `python` and click on the channel `# lunchtimepython`. Make sure you go down to the bottom of the screen and click `Join`.

6. You're good to go! This will be your first port of call for anything related to the course materials.

## Step 2: Introduction to Automate the Boring Stuff

A great teacher, Al Sweigart, created an open source beginners guide to python programming called [Automate the Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/). It is a great resource with an online text book and youtube videos. Since it aligns so closely to our course, we will use it throughout the course. It is a great place to go if you want more information.

Please watch this [short video](https://youtu.be/1F_OgqRuSdI) to get started. Ignore the download instructions, we will get to that.

## Step 3: Install Python

You may have heard it said that python is a programming language. So why do we need to install anything? We need to install the 'interpreter' that understands our python code and tells the computer what to do. That is the first step.

Arup's DTG have added python to ArupApps for you in two flavours: the vanilla python installer for Windows, and the Anaconda 3 python distribution. The recommended approach for those new to python is to request Anaconda 3, which comes pre-packaged with a large number of commonly used libraries, including Arup's `gsapy`, Jupyter notebooks, and many more.

After the software has installed, go to your start menu and look for `IDLE (Python 3.X 64-bit)` if you installed vanilla python, or `Anaconda Prompt` if you installed Anaconda 3. The IDLE window will look like this:

Please get in touch if you get stuck.

## Step 4: Install Visual Studio Code (NOT Visual Studio)

In the videos you have been watching from Automate the Boring Stuff, Al uses a text editor called IDLE that comes standard with python. You can use this if you want. However, we suggest using a more advanced editor called Visual Studio Code (we use it on a daily basis). You can request it from [ArupApps](http://gloarupapps01/Shopping/requestItem/detail?id=1165).

Once it has installed, open the program and install the python extension. This is a language extension for the editor to help you develop code, navigate your python versions, support your git workflows, and generally make your life easier. More details can be found [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python). The [Extension Marketplace](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery) has instructions for installing extensions in VS Code.

## Step 5: Your First Problem Set

You are now set up. Let's take python for a spin.

In each session we provide a problem set. As part of your pre work, watch the [next video](https://youtu.be/7qHMXu99d88) from automate the boring stuff and then try to solve the problems in **Session 0**.

Use slack to ask questions if you get stuck.

See you in the first session!

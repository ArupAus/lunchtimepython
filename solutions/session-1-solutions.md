# Session 1 Problems

In session 1 we learned:

1. How to import a module
2. Flow control and conditionals
3. How to use loops

Work through the following questions at your own pace. Don't forget to ask questions if you get stuck!

## A little theory

- What is the difference between the equal to operator `==` and the assignment operator `=`?
- What is an infinite loop?
- What is the difference between break and continue?
- Which Python utility can you use to run a loop a certain amount of times?

*ANS:*

*What is the difference between the equal to operator `==` and the assignment operator `=`?* The equal to operator compares whether one value is equal to another and evaluates to a bool ('True' or 'False'), where the assignment operator takes the expression on the right and assigns it to the variable on the left.
'a == 4' returns 'True' or 'False' depending on the value of 'a'
'a = 4' assigns '4' to the variable 'a'

*What is an infinite loop?* The computer is stuck in a 'while' or a 'for' that never ends.
*What is the difference between break and continue?* 'break' will break out of a loop completely, where 'continue' will skip whatever remains in the loop body and begins the next iteration.
*Which Python utility can you use to run a loop a certain amount of times?* The 'for' loop is perfect for this.

## Journey to work

How far do you have to travel to get to work? Ask the user how many kms they travel to work, then give them a suggestion based on their repsonse:
- if the user travels greater than 5km to work, print 'You should take the train.'
- if the user travels greater than 2km to work, print 'You should cycle.'
- if the user travels 2km or less to work, print 'Stop being lazy and walk!'

Here are some example inputs and their expected outputs:

|Input|Output|
|-----|------|
|6|'You should take the train.'|
|4|'You should cycle'|
|2|'Stop being lazy and walk!'|

*ANS:*
```py
distance = float(input("How far do you travel to work? "))

if distance > 5:
	print("You should take the train.")
elif distance > 2:
	print("You should cycle.")
else:
	print("Stop being lazy and walk!")
```

## FizzBuzz

Iterate over each number from 1 to 100. For each number (n) in the range, do the following:
- if n is divisible by 3, print 'Fizz' to the console
- if n is divisible by 5, print 'Buzz' to the console
- if n is divisible by 3 *and* 5, print 'FizzBuzz' to the console
- if none of the above apply, just print n to the console

*ANS:*
```py
for n in range(1, 100):
	if n%3==0 and n%5==0:
		print("FizzBuzz")
	elif n%3==0:
		print("Fizz")
	elif n%5==0:
		print("Buzz")
	else:
		print(n)
```

## Double char

Ask the user to input a string. Return this string, with every character (char) repeated twice.

e.g. 'python' should become 'ppyytthhoonn'

Teacher's pet edition: Ask the user for an number (n) as well. Repeat each char in the given string n times.

*ANS:*
For the examples in class we used the 'range()' method with 'for' loops. But the 'for' loop can iterate over any collection of things. In the case of 'range()', the for loop is iterating over a collection of intergers (ints) that the 'range()' method builds for us. For example:
'range(6) = [0,1,2,3,4,5]'
So when we use 'for n in range(6)', we are actually looping though each integer in the collection '[0,1,2,3,4,5]'.

We can also think of a string as a collection of characters:
'"A Ham" = ["A", " ", "H", "a", "m"]'
So we can use a 'for' loop to iterate over a collection of characters in a string.

```py
word = input("Enter a word you would like me to double: ")
doubleWord = "" # initialise doubleWord as an empty string
for character in word:
	doubleWord = doubleWord + character*2
print(doubleWord)
```

## Sum

Calculate the sum of:

- every number from 1 to 100
```py
sum=0
for n in range(1,100):
	sum = sum + n
print("This sum from 1 to 100 is: "+str(sum))
```
- every **odd** number from 1 to 100
```py
sum=0
for n in range(1,100):
	if n%2!=0:
		sum = sum + n
print("This sum of every odd number from 1 to 100 is: "+str(sum))
```
- every number from 1 to 100 **divisible by 3**
```py
sum=0
for n in range(1,100):
	if n%3==0:
		sum = sum + n
print("This sum of every number divisible by 3 from 1 to 100 is: "+str(sum))
```

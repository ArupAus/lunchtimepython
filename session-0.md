## A little theory
Which of the following are operators, and which are values?

```py
*
'hello'
-88.8
-
/
+
5
```

Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?

```py
'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'
```

## Computers love arithmetic
Write a script that prompts the user for two numbers, multiplies the numbers together and prints the result to the console.

```py
# To prompt the user to enter a value
my_string = input("Message to the user")
```

## Division
What is 17 divided by 3?
How many times does 3 divide into 17?

## Rounding numbers
Write a script that prompts the user for a floating point number and the number of decimal places to round the number, print the rounded number to the console. Python has a tool for doing this: `round()`.

Sample input/output:
```
>>> Enter a floating point number: 2.0453687
>>> How many decimal places would you like: 3
>>> The rounded number is: 2.045
```

## Greetings
Write a script that prompts the user for their full name, then print a message to the console. A sample is shown below (Google "python string split" if you get stuck).
Sample input/output:
```
>>> What is your full name: Alex Smith
>>> Hello Smith, Alex
```
